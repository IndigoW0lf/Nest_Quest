# Nest Quest

Nest Quest is a web application designed as a personal project so that I could explore, discover, and decide where to live in the U.S. based on data-driven insights. This project is divided into two main parts: a React frontend hosted on GitHub Pages and a Flask backend hosted on Heroku.
